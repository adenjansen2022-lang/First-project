                            Renewable energy is energy that is naturally created or made by nature, it is a natural resource, and it can be continuously replenished(Sørensen, 2004). 
                            Natural resources such as sunlight, wind, water/waves, geothermal heat and organic materials like compost which are used to generate solar power, wind power 
                            and hydro power(Sørensen, 2004). All of this is used to generate electricity and much more, while non-renewable resources  such as fossil fuels like coal and 
                            oil can only be created every few hundred or even million years(Sørensen, 2004). 
                            <br>
                            Renewable resources are different from non-renewable resources as renewable resources can continuously carry on being replenished, it barely produces emissions 
                            into the air, it is very sustainable, and it has a minimal impact on the environment(Tugcu, Ozturk and Aslan, 2012).While non-renewable energy is not replenishable 
                            and can only be produced by the earth every one hundred to an million years, it does produce emissions such as High CO2 and pollutants, it does not last forever 
                            and it does affect the environment such as climate change(Tugcu, Ozturk and Aslan, 2012). 
                            <br>
                            It is called renewable energy because it is continuously replenished by natural, as the sun rises every morning, waves are constantly roaring, rivers are flowing, 
                            winds are blowing and plants regrow(Sørensen, 2004).It is important to us as it helps us fight climate change, improves the quality of the air, gives individuals
                            energy independence, saves money and supports economic growth(Sørensen, 2004).

                            Wind Energy is a renewable energy and it uses the motion of wind in order to make electricity through the use of a wind turbine, it is one of the most
                            safest and sustainable renewable resources in the world(Blaabjerg and Ma, 2017). In the early 20th century, they used to use windmills which are still 
                            used today in some remote areas, which was used to pump water for planation and now we have turbines which can be used to power or schools, universities, 
                            businesses and even entire cities(Blaabjerg and Ma, 2017).The main components of the wind turbine is the blades, rotor, Nacelle, Gearbox, Tower and 
                            foundation(Burton et al., 2011).

                            <dd>Wind is caught inside the blades- aerodynamic blades catch the wind causing them to start spinning</dd>
                            <dd>Rotor spins- this is where all the blades are connected onto </dd>
                            <dd>Gearbox increases speed- this gearbox changes the low speed of the rotor into his speed to generate electricity</dd>
                            <dd>Generator produces electricity- gearbox that is connected to the generator converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy. </dd>
                            <dd>Power is transferred to a central grid- power here is sent through a transformer and increases the voltage to send through power lines </dd>

                            Wind energy depends less on non-renewable energy sources and, in doing so, emits less carbon and CO2. Wind turbines also produce fewer PM2.5 particles as
                            well as other dangerous substances, which has a positive effect on human health as well as the air quality. The use of wind turbines reduces acid rain,
                            which in turn has a positive effect on plants and buildings. It was furthermore found that offshore wind farms, under certain circumstances, can have a
                            positive effect on biodiversity. These benefits include the creation of new habitats such as artificial reefs. A study done in the North Sea showed a 
                            growth in marine life numbers due to certain areas being off limits to fishing​ ( Bošnjaković, Hrkać, Stoić, & Hradovi, 2024, pp. 1-5)​. 
                            <br>
                            According to … wind farms have a minimal impact on the environment because the wind turbines can be demolished if they serve no more use. The demolition 
                            of wind turbines causes no harm to the environment and allows the land to be used for other purposes. Wind turbines utilize a renewable source, meaning 
                            that the Earth's natural resources won’t be exhausted eventually due to the production of wind energy ​(Assareh, et al., 2025, p. 2)​.

                            The future of wind energy hinges on overcoming certain challenges. Due to the irregular nature of wind, as wind does not blow constantly creating unpredictable 
                            and unreliable energy generation, flexible backup systems and forecasting tools will be required (Gonzalez-Aparicio et al., 2017). These backup systems often rely
                            on fossil fuels, undermining the impact of green energy. Large scale deployment also requires significant investment, optimal sites being remote which increases 
                            logistical costs (Edghill, 2025) and reform to simplify land use conflicts (IRENA,2023). 
                            <br>
                            A major limitation is the effect of wind turbines on natural life, disrupting bird and bat populations through collisions and displacement (Edghill, 2025). Visually large wind farms, 
                            alongside the low noise they emit, can lead to resistance from populations nearby, leading to delays in development.

                            Wind energy will play an important role in the transition to more renewable sources of energy. From a report published by the International Energy Agency, wind will
                            become the largest form of energy generation in Europe by 2030 (IEA,2021). Breakthroughs in the field such as offshore platforms, which allows turbines to be placed 
                            in previously inaccessible locations in deep-water (Musial et al., 2022), increased capacity, reduced cost and efficiency will allow wind energy to be even more 
                            competitive with fossil fuels. 
                            <br>
                            With nations escalate their commitments to cleaner energies under structures like the Paris Agreement, wind energy will become a cornerstone in sustainable energy 
                            production, if technical, financial and policy hurdles are addressed correctly with global effort.
